This repository contains outputs from the DigData NHS Step Up Challenge for R, which includes an R markdown file and an html document containing report of the analysis results.

--------

## Overview of the Report and Analysis
This report provides description and analysis on antidepressant prescribing trends in England from January 2021 to December 2024. Specifically, this report looks into the total number of antidepressant prescribed and its associated prescribing costs at both national and regional levels. The aim of this analysis is to uncover and understand the trends behind antidepressant prescribing in England, especially in relation to the drugs prescribed.

## Summary of the Results
A high-level summary of this report includes: 

- The total number of antidepressants prescribed in England were increasing every year. In 2024, there was 11% more prescribed antidepressants compared to 2021.
- However, the total prescribing costs decreased by over 20% during the analysis period.
- Sertraline and Venlafaxine were the two biggest drivers of changes in antidepressant prescribing volumes and costs in England.
- The average cost per item is an important metric to consider when analysing both prescribing volumes and costs of antidepressants in England.
